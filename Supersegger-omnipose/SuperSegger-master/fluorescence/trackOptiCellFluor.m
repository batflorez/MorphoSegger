% trackOptiCellFluor : Computes fluorescence statistics
%
% INPUT :
%       fluor: fluorescence image
%       mask : cell mask
%       r_offset : offset in global coordinates
% OUTPUT :
%       fl.sum : sum of fluorescence of all pixels within cell mask
%       fl.r : the coordinates of the center of mass of the fluorescence
%       fl.Ixx : second moment of fluorescence along X 
%       fl.Iyy : second moment of fluorescence along Y
%       fl.Ixy : second moment of fluorescence along YX
