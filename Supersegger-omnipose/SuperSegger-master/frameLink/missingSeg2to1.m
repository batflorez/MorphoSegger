function [data_new,success] = missingSeg2to1 (data_c,regC,data_r,regR,data_f,regF,CONST)
% missingSeg2to1 : finds missing segment in regC.
% Segments in regC are used that are close to the segment
% between the two regions regR(1) and regR(2) in data_r.
% if a segment is found that fits the requirements data_new is made with
% the new cell_mask and success is returned as true. Else the same data is
% returned and success is false.
%
% INPUT :
%      data_c : current data (seg/err) file.
%      regC : numbers of region in current data that needs to be separated
%      data_r : reverse data (seg/err) file.
%      regR : numbers of regions in reverse data file
%      data_f : forward data (seg/err) file.
%      regF : numbers of regions in forward data file
%      CONST : segmentation parameters
%
% OUTPUT :
%      data_new : data_c with new segment in good_segs and modified cell mask
%      success : true if segment was found succesfully.
