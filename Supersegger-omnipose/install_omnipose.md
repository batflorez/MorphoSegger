# Step-by-step Omnipose installation instructions (command line based, assumes cellpose is not already installed)

 Note: this page is a work in progress and intended as a general guide. Feel free to open an issue if there are errors in the installation process

 Note: Omnipose has been updated. If Omnipose was previously installed as Cellpose, feel free to remove the pre-existing installation `conda env remove -n cellpose` and delete the cellpose folder

## Windows

1. Install git (https://git-scm.com/download/win)

> Note: recommended to add to PATH (ie select 'Use Git from Windows Command Prompt' option, not the 'Use Git from Git Bash only' option)

2. Install miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

> Warning: If added to PATH, can run miniconda directly from Command Line, but may cause interferences with other programs in Command Line. If not added to PATH, need to use the separate Anaconda Prompt to run. To manually add conda to PATH, try adding `C:\Users\Name\miniconda3\condabin;` to Path in Environment Variables. May be instead `C:\Users\Name\miniconda3\Scripts;` 

3. In Command Window/Anaconda Prompt, create "omnipose" environment, install Python to the environment, activate environment, and install Omnipose.

> Note: for Windows, found compatibility issue with latest version of Python (v3.10.5). 3.8.5 recommended but other versions may work as well.

```
conda create -n omnipose python==3.8.5
```

```
conda activate omnipose
```

```
pip install git+https://github.com/kevinjohncutler/omnipose.git
```
>   Note: for the latest stable release of Omnipose from PyPi, use instead: `pip install omnipose` (June 19 2022 - not yet supported)

> Note: activate the omnipose environment each time you want to use omnipose with `conda activate omnipose`.

4. For updating, repeat the above install command after activating omnipose environment:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/kevinjohncutler/omnipose.git
```
